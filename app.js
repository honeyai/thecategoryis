/***************************************************************************
- I need to start testing on one word then do the point below. 
- I need an array for the words. probably 10 words.
 - defi will use a for loop.
 - Not sure if I'm gonna use .map, .push .join and .splice
 - I can have the word .length to represent the number of _ _ .
 - The game function will have a while loop. 
 - The word randomization will be Math.floor(Math.random()* the array . length)
 - The player will know if they win or lose by an alert window.  
 - will use canvas to draw the makeup table. 10 attempts.
 - There's an option where I draw the makeup table and cover it with a clear object and with every wrong answer the clear object disappears.
 - The attempts are: 1 for the mirror, 1 for the table, 1 for the lights. 4 for the table legs. 3 for the makeup.
 - don't forget to call your functions.
